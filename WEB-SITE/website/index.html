                   <ul>
                        <li> Start with the Easy Numbers – Look for rows, columns, or boxes that alrea
                           dy have many numbers filled in. These are easier to complete..</li>
                        <li> Use the “Only Choice” Rule – If a number can only go in one spot
                             within a row, column, or box, place it there immediately..</li>
                        <li> Avoid Guessing – Sudoku is a logic-based game. If you guess,
                             you might create an error that ruins the whole puzzle.</li>

                     <li> Block Your Opponent – Always keep an eye on your opponent’s moves and block them if

                     <li> Use the Corners Strategically – If your opponent takes the center, playing in a corner

                  <li> Block Your Opponent – If your opponent is close to connecting four, prioritize blocking them over
                     making an offensive move.</li>

                  <li> Stay Focused – Keep your eyes on the entire board rather than fixating

                  <li>Aim for the Fast Moles First – Some versions have different types of moles, with faster 
                      ones giving more points. Prioritize these to maximize your score.</li>
                  <li> Stay Relaxed, But Alert – If you panic, you may react too slowly. 
                      Keep calm and trust your reflexes.</li>
                  <li>Don’t Randomly Tap or Hit – Accuracy is key! If you miss too many times,
                     you might lose points or get penalties in some versions of the game.</li>
                  <li>Upgrade Your Hammer (If Available) – In some digital or arcade versions,
